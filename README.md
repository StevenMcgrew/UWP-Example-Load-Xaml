# UWP-Example-Load-Xaml
This sample shows how to load xaml at runtime.

This is a very simple example that only adds one button and the click event for that button, but you can actually load a very complex xaml text file such as a Grid with many child objects within it. I created a folder called MyXamlFiles to store any xaml files that are to be loaded.
